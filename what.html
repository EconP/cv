   <h3>Fins</h3>
   <p>Fins has got plans to farm the largest two deserts in the world. If you dont know them. The land deserts, which the sahara is amongst.
       And then the sea desert, Pacific and Atlantic.        
       <em>They plan to farm and make forests out of the land deserts, the sand dunes will become green hills,
           and the driest of them vallies shall be made fresh water creeks. 
       </em>
       Ponds with clean water and fresh water fishes will run through the lands from its human propelled source. 
       sanctifying and making the lands green. People will be able to farm food on the desert, bovines and other
       large and small grass eaters will graze on fresh moors.

    For the seas, fins as a company habours the agenda to grow salmons and other economically valued fishes in large floating net cages, this isn't
    a new thing. For many countries outside, they have been practicing this kind of aquaculture for a long time now.
    Countries like the USA, Austrialia, Iceland and others. <em>Due to some ugly effects that this practice of aquaculture comes back to
        hit the enviroment with, especially from the standview of the natural habitats of other aquatic animals. As a result of
        antibiotics used on the fishes, pesticides used to control sea lice, excess feeds becoming waste on the ocean,
        high ammonia produced from the fish bio-wastes, and a lot others.
    </em>
    Fins has a mega plan to also farm see weeds and mussels, which are organisms that their prime medium of survival, is filtering the ocean waters.
       <h3>Miggles</h3>
    Miggles has got a plan that will work hand in hand with Fins, and this is what it is. Miggle's <em>CEO</em> first started the
    company as an ice cream man when he was stil in school. Well, as growth is expected, other pleasing fast foods joined the menu sooner.
    Miggles could serve the population on itself, but a partnership with fins will make things smooter. 
    Fins want to make food and farm products cheaper an more affordable, and to have a restaurant through which they serve the people directly.
    Miggles is an option, a good one. What happens is that a stage is created, upon which someone can visit a supermarket
    that sells mostly farm products at a cheaper rate, then also an eatry with the most expensive and tastiest of dishes made affordable.
